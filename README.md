## Reminder

1. **If you have problems with `core-component`, ensure your `core-component` version matches the master branch.**
2. **If deploying to production, remember to deploy from a version branch to adhere to TBD best practices**
3. **If a core component does not fit your needs, _extend_ the core component in the [core components repo](https://github.com/storipress/core-component) and open a PR â€” this way, you can avoid hacky workarounds**

## How to rebase/merge master

### rebase master

1. git fetch
2. git rebase origin/master
3. git push -f (**ONLY IF YOU ARE IN YOUR OWN BRANCH**)

This will rebase your current branch to master. Rebasing will produce a pretty history, but it may produce conflicts.
If you don't know how to solve the conflicts, you can use `git rebase --abort` to abort the rebase and try to use merge instead.

### merge master

1. git fetch
2. git merge origin/master
3. git push

This will merge your current branch to the master. Merging will create a new commit, and it may be easier to resolve any conflicts.
